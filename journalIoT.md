connecting to wifi, mqtt ,serial communication and logging with adafruit.

Keeping up with the typing. We pair programed and my partner was driving, helped me but I think it was unfair on him.


## three

How pull up and pull down works with signals. putting the library for the board onto the computer.

Still struggle with not having a full featured IDE. All my macro, variable constance are no more the three characters. 

## two 

I learnt more about c, making circuits and arduino. With c I have gone to deep so I am sure it will get more complicated but for now a decision is easy to understand. Practicing making circuits is something need to do more. The basics of making a circuit I think I understand but as soon as it goes beyond that I spend a lot of time debugging it. I also learnt more about arduino and needing to take into account blocking commands.

I struggled with writing code into tinkercad and not having IDE helping, I fell behind more than a few times in class. Also I am still coming to grips with making the circuits it takes me a while to debug them after I make them.
